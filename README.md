# BleemSync
BleemSync is a relatively safe way to add games to your PlayStation Classic.

## Features
1. Overmounts portions of the PSC's filesystem to safely allow modifications
1. Modifies the stock UI to show added games
1. Supports multi-disc games
1. Automatically downloads game metadata and cover art
1. Runs on boot of the PlayStation Classic

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP file from the [release page](https://github.com/pathartl/BleemSync/releases/latest)
1. Extract the contents to the root of your FAT32 or ext4 formatted USB flash drive
1. Name your flash drive `SONY`. This is a requirement.

## Automatic Game Configuration
BleemSync has the ability to download game info from BleemSync Central, an online database. To utilize automatic metadata scraping, make sure your folder structure looks something like this:
```
games/
    1/
        GameData/
            Cool Boarders.bin
            Cool Boarders.cue
    2/
        GameData/
            Cool Boarders 2.bin
            Cool Boarders 2.cue            
    Need For Speed III/
        Need For Speed III.cue
        Need For Speed III.bin
```
On the root of your flash drive, create a `games` folder. In this folder, create a folder for each game you would like to add to the system.

Please note that it is not mandatory to have your `bin`/`cue` files named something specific. However, your `cue` file must reference your `bin` file exactly. The name of these files has no effect on the automatic metadata scraping. BleemSync will find the serial number embedded in the disc image and run it against the database.

From here, you can skip the "Manual Game Configuration" step and move onto "Synchronization".

**Please at this time do not submit any issues related to a specific game not existing in BleemSync Central's database or low-quality cover images. Please use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z_BT65fIFUPp1LXCFqEnCzyVpgf2cvHIgicJqsalrl8/edit?usp=sharing) for tracking missing games.**

**Also please note that automatic metadata scraping may not work with multi-track `.bin`s at this time. [Please follow this tutorial](http://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=41) to learn how to make a single `bin` image.**

**Also also please note that automatic metadata scraping will not run on boot of the system as it has no internet connectivity. Please run on a desktop/laptop to use this feature.**

## Manual Game Configuration
On the root of your flash drive, create a `games` folder. In this folder, create a folder for each game you would like to add to the system. Each game folder must contain a `Game.ini`, cover art image, `pcsx.cfg`, and the game's `bin` and `cue` files. A template of the `games` folder can be found in the release ZIP.

A proper folder structure looks something like this:
```
games/
    Final Fantasy VII/
        Game.ini
        pcsx.cfg
        Final Fantasy VII CD1.cue
        Final Fantasy VII CD1.bin
        Final Fantasy VII CD2.cue
        Final Fantasy VII CD2.bin
        Final Fantasy VII CD3.cue
        Final Fantasy VII CD3.bin
    Need For Speed III/
        Game.ini
        pcsx.cfg
        Need For Speed III.cue
        Need For Speed III.bin
    Crash Bandicoot/
        ...

```

Please note:

You can also use the old folder structure from Bleemsync < 0.7 . Be aware that this will be deprecated soon!
```
games/
    1/
        GameData/
            Game.ini
            pcsx.cfg
            SLUS-01066.bin
            SLUS-01066.cue
            SLUS-01066.png
    2/
        ...
    3/
        ...
```
It is recommended, though not necessary that the game's filenames use the appropriate disc ID.

The `pcsx.cfg` file can be copied without modification as it's the same config that is shipped with the system's games.

For each game, the `Game.ini` must be customized in order to be displayed in the menu correctly. The `Discs` value should be the name of the `.cue` file without the file extension. Sample:
```
[Game]
Discs=SLUS-01066
Title=Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2
Publisher=Activision
Players=2
Year=2000
```

### Multi-disc games
For multi-disc games, add both `bin` and `cue` files for each disc into the game's numbered folder and make a config that looks like:
```
[Game]
Discs=SLUS-00665,SLUS-00667
Title=Command & Conquer - Red Alert
Publisher=Westwood Studios
Players=1
Year=1998
```

## Synchronization
Once all the games are configured, go into the `BleemSync` directory and run `BleemSync.exe`. This will generate a `System` folder containing the newly generated database and a script to safely mount the games. Insert the flash drive into your PlayStation Classic and then turn it on. Your newly added games should be on display.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### It takes a few seconds more than normal for my system to boot
BleemSync runs on boot of the system. If this is taking too long or malfunctions, simply remove the System/BleemSync folder from your flash drive.

### I can't format my flash drive to FAT32 | Formatting to FAT32 doesn't let me use all of the storage available
Use [guiformat.exe](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm)

### My controller isn't working
Make sure your `pcsx.cfg` is in the game directory

### I'm getting a UI error upon boot
Make sure that you unplug the power on your system before you remove or add your flash drive.

### Are my original games intact?
Yes. Remove the flash drive and the stock games should be available

### Can I add games alongside the pre-included ones?
Not currently.

### What size does the cover art have to be?
The cover art should be square (1:1 aspect ratio). If the cover art is not square, it will be squashed by the UI as square anyway so visually it's best to pre-crop it. The system uses 226x226px images for the pre-loaded games.

### My controller still isn't working
Your user data might have gotten messed up. Try going to Settings and then Initialize Console. **This will wipe out any saves and save states, proceed with caution!**

### When I boot, I get a 001-001 error!
Make sure you have run BleemSync on your PC. This usually means the game database which BleemSync builds cannot be found.

### The Sony logo appears, but then I am kicked to an error screen and that says "An error has occurred. Turn off the console, unplug the AC adapter, then turn on the console again.
On your USB drive, go to `System/Preferences` and remove `regional.pre`. If this doesn't work, start up your PlayStation Classic without your USB drive inserted, select Battle Arena Toshinden, and then unplug the machine. Plug it back in along with your USB drive and it should now boot into the menu.

## Known Issues/Limitations
* Games have to be in sequential order. This is a limit imposed by BleemSync. Further testing has to be done to see if this is a system limitation
* Games have to be in `bin`/`cue` format. This is a limit imposed by the system's UI
* Other regions may not be working at this time
